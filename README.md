# Calling Custom .NET Component from an Innovator Action

The sample demonstrates how to create and call a custom .NET component from Innovator's action/JavaScript method.

In the sample, .NET component creates an instance of MS Excel application that is later used to open an Excel file.
In general, the ability to call a method of a custom .NET component allows users to do pretty much anything: talk to another process; read/write information from/to file on disk; etc.
